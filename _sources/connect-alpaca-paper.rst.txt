Connect to Alpaca Markets for Paper Trading and Market Data
===========================================================

.. note::
   Stocks data feeds available only in *Latinum* (standard edition)
   and *Latinum Stocks for Mac*.

An Alpaca Markets Trading API account is required. Please visit `alpaca.markets <https://alpaca.markets/>`_ and sign up for one. Paper Trading accounts are free and don't require identity documents.

Visit your `Alpaca dashboard <https://app.alpaca.markets/brokerage/dashboard/overview>`_ and look for the **API Keys** section in the right sidebar. Click on **Generate New Keys**. Save the new Key ID and Secret Key somewhere where you can copy them into Latinum. If you forget your keys, you can regenerate them.

Please read the `Alpaca documentation <https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/getting-started-with-alpaca-market-data#generate-api-keys>`_ for updated instructions if those provided here are incorrect.

Open Latinum. The :ref:`Broker Selection <broker-selection-window>` window will be displayed. This window is sometimes called the Connection Selection window. Select **Alpaca Paper** and click **OK**.

The Alpaca Login window will be displayed. Paste in the Key ID and Secret Key you generated earlier. Click on **OK**.
