#. Select 
   **Rate** to specify the Stop Loss order price, or select **Pips** to specify the Stop Loss order in pips offset from the orders entry price.
   
   If you enter the value in pips, the value is negative for buy entry orders, positive for sell entry orders.
   
   If there is no existing Stop order attached to the Entry order you put a tick into the 
   **Stop** checkbox. To remove the Stop order uncheck the **Stop** checkbox.
#. To make your stop order to a trailing stop, select Fixed or Dynamic. If you select Fixed trailing enter the step size in pips into the next box.
#. Select **OK** to submit your modified order, or **Cancel** to close the dialog discarding your changes.
   
   If no errors occur the dialog box will close automatically, otherwise the error message will be displayed.
