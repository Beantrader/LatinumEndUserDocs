Version 8.0.1
=============

Beantrader Latinum version 8.0.1 is a bugfix release.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### General
   * Updated the IEX data feed adding many new international exchanges.
     The list of new exchanges is included below [^1]. It is highly
     recommended you use the new Exchange Blacklist setting in the IEX
     Connection Settings window to disable all the exchanges you won't be
     using, more on the new window below.

### Datafeed
   * Added Percent Change to Alpaca quotes
   * Fixed Bitfinex WebSocket ping/pong and heartbeat interval
   * TIINGO
      * Fixed EOD values overwriting newer IEX values in the quotes table
      * Fixed delay connecting Tiingo IEX WebSocket
      * Fixed empty Tiingo percent change column
   * IEX
      * Added IEX Connection Settings window with options to control the
        adjusted price method (between split-only and fully adjusted) and
        an option to blacklist exchanges. Blacklisting exchanges reduces
        the amount of memory the app consumes, makes app startup time
        faster, reduces the amount of data downloaded, and speeds up
        symbol searches. You can open the new settings window from
        File > Broker > Connection Settings.
      * Improved process for updating and storing IEX symbols
