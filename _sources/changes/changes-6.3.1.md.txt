Version 6.3.1
==============

Beantrader Latinum version 6.3.1 is a bugfix release.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### General
   * Added the slash - '/' keyboard shortcut to the symbol search
     dialog. When an entry in the results table is selected you can
     press '/' to return focus back to the query text entry. This
     improves keyboard-only symbol changing. As in previous versions,
     you can press the down key from the text entry to select a result.
   * Fixed application UI locking up when switching to a symbol using
     either Poloniex, Gemini, or HitBTC data feeds. The UI would
     occasionally lock up or freeze for up to 5 seconds while waiting
     for data to be received.

### Drawing
   * Changed behaviour of Selection tool (aka Black Arrow tool), the
     tool now allows moving a drawings anchor points (shown when
     hovering) without first having to select the drawing. This reduces
     the number of clicks required to move a point from two to one.

### Datafeed
   * POLONIEX
      * Changed chart data to use quote volume instead of base volume
   * HUOBI
      * Fixed infinite scrolling chart data (aka on-demand loading)
   * HADAX
      * Added Huobi HADAX charts, trade, and quote data. Note, HADAX
        log or error messages may contain the word Huobi in place of
        HADAX.
