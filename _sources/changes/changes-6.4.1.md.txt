### General
   * Added an option to show only subscribed symbols in the symbol
     search window, this setting is remembered while the app is running
   * Replaced the drop-down list used to select the chart symbol with a
     button that displays a symbol search window. The same change was
     made to the price alert editor window

### Charts
   * Added option to show bars with zero volume, it is located in Data
     section of Chart Properties window. Bars with zero volume have an
     open, high, low, and close price equal to the previous close price

     sometimes occur when viewing a symbol without enough data to fill
     the screen

     different session times (e.g switching from OKEx to GDAX)

     chart templates. The value is now ignored if the field is not
     available for the charts current instrument

     streaming prices, it updates every 10 seconds

     data for: Transaction Count, Transaction Volume, Fees, Network
