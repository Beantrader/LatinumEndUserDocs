Version 7.5.0
=============

Beantrader Latinum version 7.5 contains bug fixes and new features.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### General
   * Added option to specify user interface (UI) color theme. Darker and
     Light themes were added. The UI color theme does not affect the chart
     color scheme.
   * Added an HTTP request timeout to all requests. Timeout is set to 30
     seconds in most cases.
   * Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>/</kbd> shortcut to hide the main window
     status bar
   * Added <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> shortcut to hide the toolbar in
     Trade Feed and Order Book windows
   * Added option to display Trade Feed and Order Book windows in the
     workspace area. When added to the workspace area the symbol, display,
     and/or filtering options will also be saved with the workspace.

### Charts
   * Improved the symbol lookup window. The list of recent symbols and
     Show Subscribed Symbols Only option is now saved when you exit the
     app
   * Changed to not track right (auto-scroll) when new bars added if the
     chart was panned backwards in time (ignoring the track rick chart
     setting)
   * Added floating buttons to scroll the chart one bar backwards or
     forwards. These buttons appear when the chart is panned backwards
     (i.e the last bar is not visible)
   * Enable Month (M1) interval on crypto feeds

### Datafeed
   * Improved efficiency of all crypto streaming feeds in processing trade
     data used to update charts. This results in less CPU usage and should
     avoid lockups during periods of extremely high trading activity
   * Fixed bug where charts don't update for some time in non-streaming
     crypto feeds where the chart interval is resampled and no trade
     occurred in the first base bar
   * Added BitBay (BITBAY), FTX, Binance Futures (BINANCEFUTURES), and
     Bitpanda (BITPANDA) chart data feeds. These data feeds do not use
     streaming prices, they update every 10 seconds.
   * Fixed HitBTC data feed. They broke it!
   * Fixed OKEx volume shown in charts

### Order Book
   * Added 0.5 tick increment option for price grouping
