Version 8.5.0
=============

Beantrader Latinum version 8.5 contains bug fixes and new features.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### Charts
   * Added abbreviations for billions (B) and trillions (T) in scale
     labels. This change makes it easier to read large indicator values,
     like volume for instruments that trade at fractions of a penny.
     Previously the largest abbreviation used was millions (M)

### Drawing
   * Added Deselect button to the format bar. This change makes it easier
     to deselect new drawings when the Selection tool
     (aka Black Arrow tool) is not active
   * Added spinbox for fill color opacity to the format bar. This change
     makes it easier to change the opacity of a shape without having to
     open the color picker window

### Studies
   * Added Moving Average Cloud (MaCloud) study. Inspired by the
     Bull Market Support Band described by Benjamin Cowen

### Datafeed
   * Updated the FXCM data feed (to ForexConnect 1.6.4). This fixes
     signing in to demo accounts
   * Removed Huobi Russia, Binance Jersey, ACX, OKEx Korea, and
     Crypto Facilities data feeds
