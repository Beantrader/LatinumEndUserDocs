Version 6.5.0
=============

Beantrader Latinum version 6.5 contains bug fixes and new features.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### Charts
   * Fixed issue where price axis labels would sometimes not be drawn
   * Changed how drawings that were drawn on a smaller interval are
     positioned when switching chart to a larger interval. The time
     is now rounded down instead of rounding to closest bar time.

### Drawing
   * Fixed sign (+/-) used to calculate gain/loss on price dimension
     tool
   * Fixed drawing extended vertical lines when chart is log scale,
     this affected Cycle Lines, Fib Time, and Vertical Line tools.

### Studies
   * Added Awesome Oscillator indicator. Access the indicator from
     the Custom Studies menu
   * Added EMA/SMA Crossover Candle studies, these two studies color
     candlesticks based on either an EMA cross or an SMA cross. The
     chart type should be set to Invisible when using these studies.
   * Added Volume with SMA study. This is a different study than the
     Volume study located in the Builtin menu, access this version
     from the Custom Studies menu
   * Added additional Bollinger Bands indicator. This implementation
     is recommended over the one provided by TA-Lib if you view
     instruments with very small price values (e.g sub-cent altcoins).
   * Added Inverse Pair study. This study displays candlesticks of the
     inverse of the main symbols price (i.e 1/price).

### Datafeed
   * IEX
      * Updated as IEX now provide open and close values for minute data
   * BINANCE
      * Reduced CPU usage
