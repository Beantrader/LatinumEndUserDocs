Version 7.8.0
=============

Beantrader Latinum version 7.8 contains bug fixes and new features.

The most important changes are listed in this document.

### General
   * Improved multi-monitor support. Modal windows created by main windows
     will not block input in other main windows
   * Fixed several memory leaks

### Charts
   * Added scrolling without active Hand tool. This allows you to scroll
     the chart using your mouse or touchpad without having to switch to
     the Hand tool first
   * Added horizontal wheel scrolling. Horizontal and vertical scrolling
     both affect the time axis only
   * Added option to show or hide Data Tip descriptive rows including
     Date, Time, Price (at mouse cursor), Bar Number, and Bar Index
   * Added Show Fractional Pip option. This is a per-chart setting that
     is also saved in templates. The default is off to keep fractional
     pips hidden
   * Fixed Session Breaks interval for m4 to m30 charts. They were
     displaying weekly instead of daily breaks

### Studies
   * Added Crossover Arrow EMA study. This plots an arrow on the first bar
     after an EMA crossover

### Datafeed
   * IEX
      * Reduced quote network requests for quotes used in the sidebar.
        The new algorithm prioritizes symbols used in charts and alerts
   * CTRADER
      * Added auto-retry for REQUEST_FREQUENCY_EXCEEDED errors when
        requesting chart data
