Symbol Lists
============

Symbol Lists are a list of symbols where each row contain the data feed ID and symbol.
The symbol lists are used in the Watchlist window (when connected to a Forex broker)
and for symbol subscription management when accessed from the Quotes Sidebar.

.. note::
   Changes made to symbol lists from the Watchlist window are automatically saved.
   Changes made to symbol lists from the Quotes Sidebar are **not** automatically saved.


Create a new Symbol List
------------------------

Using the Quotes Sidebar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create a symbol list from the sidebar but note the following:

- All selected (highlighted) symbols in the Quotes table will be included in the new list.

  If you want an empty new list, deselect all symbols in the Quotes table by clicking in a blank area of the table or you can remove them after.
- All existing subscriptions will be removed (unless selected in the Quotes table)

#. Open the More Menu (the ``...`` at the top)
#. Select ``New List``
#. A file save window will open, enter a filename and select ``OK`` (or ``Save``)

   Saving to the ``watchlists`` folder is recommended. Saving changes you make to the list will be easier to save if you save to the ``watchlists`` folder.
#. The new lists will be activated
#. Add the symbols you want

   #. Right-click the Quotes table and select ``Symbols...``
   #. Place a check-mark beside all symbols you want in the new list
   #. Select ``OK``
#. When you make any changes to the list you need to re-save the list

   - If you saved to a file in the ``watchlists`` folder select ``Overwrite '*NAME*'`` from the More Menu,
   - if you saved somewhere else select ``Save list as`` from the More Menu.


Deleting a Symbol List
----------------------

#. Select the ``Watchlists`` section (on the left side of the Library window)

Merging Multiple Symbol Lists
-----------------------------
