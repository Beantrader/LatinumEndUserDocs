   If By Price aggregation is not enabled a volume-weighted average price is calculated.

   If the incoming trade was executed on the same side (Bid or Ask) as
   the previous trade
   the incoming trades quantity is added to the last (previous) trade.

   The side with the highest value wins.

Any combination of By Price, By Time, and By Side can be selected.
